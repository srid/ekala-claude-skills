# Ekala Skills

Nix development skills for coding agents: Claude Code, Codex, Oh My Pi, and
anything else that loads [Agent Plugins](https://agent-plugins.org) packages.

## Skills

### nix-build

The `nix-build` skill assists with building Nix packages using nix-build and related Nix commands.

### nix-eval

The `nix-eval` skill assists with exploring nix evaluation and inspecting nix expressions.

### ekala-cmake-nix

The `ekala-cmake-nix` skill assists with building CMake-based Nix packages, understanding cmake-specific Nix attributes, and troubleshooting CMake builds in Nix. It provides comprehensive documentation of all Nix attributes that influence CMake builds (from the cmake setup-hook) and includes examples and best practices.

## Installation

Clone the repository, then load it in your agent:

```bash
# Oh My Pi
omp -e /path/to/ekala-claude-skills

# Claude Code
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/ekala-claude-skills

# Codex
codex plugin marketplace add /path/to/ekala-claude-skills
codex plugin add ekala@ekala
```

Any other consumer of the Agent Plugins format can point at the repository
root. Skills are namespaced `ekala:<skill>`.

For a single project in Claude Code, copy the skills into the project instead:

```bash
cp -r skills /path/to/your/project/.claude/
```
